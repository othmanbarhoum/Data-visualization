Final Report: Drug-Related Hospitalization in Scotland
1.	Introduction
Drug-related hospitalisation remains a significant public health challenge in Scotland, placing substantial strain on health services and contributing to preventable morbidity and mortality. According to the Scottish Public Health Observatory (ScotPHO), the age–sex standardised rate of drug-related hospital admissions for 2021/22–2023/24 was 181.2 per 100,000 population, indicating a persistently high burden across the population. Understanding how these admission rates have changed over time is essential for informing prevention efforts, treatment strategies, and the allocation of health-care resources. 
This report examines temporal patterns in drug-related hospitalisation rates using publicly available ScotPHO indicators. The intended audience includes public health officials and policymakers in Scotland, who require clear, accessible, and evidence-informed visual summaries to inform decision-making.
2.	Data Sources
Data for this analysis were obtained from the ScotPHO summary dataset, focusing on:
• Indicator: Drug-related hospital admissions
• Measure: Age–sex standardised rate per 100,000 population
• Time range: The specific period available in the downloaded dataset (e.g., 2010–2023/24 or 2021/22–2023/24).
To maintain accuracy and reproducibility, the analysis uses only the time periods provided in the ScotPHO extract and does not attempt to replicate example plots using unavailable or unpublished data.
3.	Purpose and Visualization Approach
The objective of this project is to provide a clear visual summary of how drug-related hospitalisation rates in Scotland have changed across the available time period.
A time-series line chart will be used. This choice is appropriate because:
• It effectively communicates changes and trends over time.
• It is familiar and easily interpreted by non-technical decision-makers.
• It aligns with the temporal structure of the ScotPHO indicator.
• It supports policy discussions by highlighting whether the burden is increasing, stable, or declining.
Visualisation specifications:
• Plot type: Line chart
• X-axis: Year (matching the dataset range)
• Y-axis: Age–sex standardised rate per 100,000 population
• Data: ScotPHO drug-related hospital admissions indicator
Only time periods present in the ScotPHO dataset will be included.

4.	Final Research Question
How have age–sex standardised drug-related hospitalisation rates in Scotland changed over time across the period available in the ScotPHO dataset?
This research question:
•	Rely solely on variables included in the dataset.
•	 Avoids unsupported distinctions such as hospital types.
•	Aligns directly with the planned data visualization.
•	It can be fully addressed using publicly available ScotPHO data.

5.	 Expected Contribution
This analysis will provide a clear, reproducible, and policy-relevant overview of trends in drug-related hospitalisation in Scotland. The findings will help public health stakeholders assess the current trajectory of drug-related harm, inform strategic planning, and guide resource allocation in clinical and preventive services.
